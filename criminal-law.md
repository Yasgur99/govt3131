# Criminal Law

Actual articulated statutory law
Not judge made law
Made by elected bodies

Makes it so the most powerful people don't always get away with breaking the law
Provies a more neutral enforcement
Avoid never ending cycle of violence

Why criminal law?

1. Retribution
  * eye for eye
  * social cohesion
    * reaffirmation  of norms

ex)
Martin Shkreli - Turing Pharmesuticals
Imprisoned for securities fraud for lying to investors about activities of his company
Company was buying smaller companies
Taking drugs that were needed by society and skyrocketing the price

Punishing him showed society that this type of action is not acceptable

ex)
Wells Fargo
Violations where bankers were creating false accounts and trading on them, garnering fees, and taking the fees from accounts others didn't approve of
Public settlement for billions of dollars

ex)
Chicago murders
* 495 murders in 2019
* 769  murders in 2020
From a social perspective, the community who loose the person has a retributive impulse

ex)
Capitol Rioteres took items from the capitol, broke things, threatned representatives
These activities are harmful to society
Society needs to see there is a punishment to reinforce norms

The retributive impulse is becoming less and less embrased by the court with regard to the dealth penalty

**What does retribute assume?**

Presumes people being punished are:
  * deserving recipied  - recognized blame
    * mercy killing?
      * what to do with moral blame where husband has incurable disease and begs to put him down
      * is the wife morally to blame? We don't know from a justice  system perspective
    * Marxism and Social Theory
      * in our society, there are multiple conditions that harm individuals who are not lucky enough to be privaleged
      * the group of individuals who engage in criminal activity because they have harsher condition
      * are these people to morally blame for their actions?
      * is it morally wrong to steal a loaf of bread to save starving family
      * this poses the question of legal wrong vs moral wrong

2. Utilitarian
  * Assumes people are rational
  * Pragmatic approach
  * Certain beehaviors we do and do not want
  * Incentives to prevent bad behavior and promote good behavior

Purposed of criminal law:
  * deter criminals
  * protect the public from bad actors (incapacitate peopel who violate)
  * rehabilitate bad actors

We want law abiding citizens to live without being under threat
People who violate laws pose a threat
So there is a usefullness to protect law abiding citizens

Once we identify bad actors we want them to move into non-criminal behavior
Good both practically and financially

Difficulties with deterrence:
  * assumes rationality
  * cost-benefit analsyis
  * benefit to doing criminal act
    * i want an apple watch
    * i dont have much money
    * if i steal it I get the watch
    * but i risk the punishment
    * criminal must weight cost of getting caught with reward
    * key component of the system is that enforcement works
    * cost (penalty) * chance caught > benefit of crime
    * Problem: cost not high enough
    * problem: chance caught not high neough
    * ex) parking rules -> is the cost of a ticket worth the payment?

Incapacitation:
* If you have bad actors you need to remove them from interacting
* if you are behind bars then you cannot commit crimes
* but what about crimes within prison?

Rehabilitation:
  * very  mixed evidence
    * low security vs supermax
    * low security can satisfy rehab
    * but supermax is more like instruction how to be a criminal

ex)
Jack Abbot Case
An author
Went into criminal justice system at young age
In and out of prison entire life
Spent most of his life in the prison social structure
This made him an asocial predator because thats what it takes to survive in prison
Norman Mailer campaigns to get him out of prison
But Abbot was an asocial predator so he stabbed a man, jailed, and commited suicide


Deterrance and Recidivism
  *  what happens to people who ahve already been in prison?
  *  numbers are mixed but show that many people go abck 
  * in alaska 50% or more go back
  * in conneticut 40-50+ for different types of crime
  * younger people recidivate more than older people


# How the criminal system operates

Recall

retribution (social/cohesion)
  * assumes  punishment deserved
utilitarinism (deter, incapacitate, rehabilitate, cost/benifit)
  * assumes people rational

Affirmative Defensive

Lifeboat Ethics (Dudley & Stevens)
  * is it not wrong to eat someone in the context of a shipwreck

Necessitiy: I did it, but its not wrong
Situation created by natural forces

# Regina v Dudley & Stephens

Ship the Mignonette from South Hampton Uk to Sydney Australia
Need to go around tip of Africa
The ship had:
  * Dudley, 31, captaion
  * Stephens, 36, mate
  * Brooks, 38, seaman
  * Parker, 17, cabin boy

Parker was in training for a position

Ship is wrecked
End up all 4 of them in ship's life boat
With only a can of turnips to eat
4 days later they got a sea turtle to eat
Crew is very dehydrated even though they had food
Last food is 12 days 
Last rain is 14 days
21 days parker gets sick
24 days out there is an aggrement
  * 3 elders agree that they will eat parker
  * sailors (in general) understand that consuming a ship mate is not wrong from sea fairing perspective
  * they did not draw straws to pick who to eat (because parker was ill)
  * dudley and stephens agree
  * brooks does not say no
  * parker not consulted
25 days out the captain kills parker
  * its usually the captains duty to do this
  * all 3 eat him
  * justification that if they didn't do this, none of them would have survived
29 days out they are rescued
They were honest about what happened

This becomes worldwise news

Special verdict
  * jury asked to find facts but not come to legal conclusion
  * jury finds that it probably would have been the case if they did not eat him they would have died
  * also found that parker likley would have died before the rescue
  * also found at time of killing there was low hope of rescue
  * also found that it didnt need to be parker
  * if court finds murder, who is guilty? Dudley and stephens
  * brooks testifies to what  happend in return for not being prosecuted

Decision

Was this murder?: yes

Does necesitty excuse?: 
  * there are well recogized jstifactions for murder (like self defense)
  * but necessity is not a defense

Jury findings that matter?:
  * probably would have died if not eaten  parker
  * parker likley would have died
  * would or likley is not for sure
Sentence?:
  * death sentence
  * but leaves it to crown to pardon
  * which it did

# Issues with this decision

Tempation is not the same as necessity?
  * better for 4 men to die? (is this a temptation)
  * didnt believe j ury assement of chance?

Was the killing rational?
  * is it more rational to starve to death  than kill?
  * Why punish for rational behavior? (no deterrence to this)
Utilitarinism and Deterrence?
  *  Dettered if you think you are dying?
  *  1 life for 3 (but whats the "best" life + classism)
Consider Holmes rule and procedure:

# United States v Holmes

Lord Coleridge does not consider  it precident
Facts:
  * Leaking lifeboat
  * crew threw 14 male  passengers over to lighten
Judge: necessity is a defense if 
  * necessity to chose exists
  * killer without fault for situation
  * no duty to victim
  *  killer no oblication to make own saftey secondary
    * ie men over women and children
    * sailors should preference passengers (special relationship) unless needed to sail boat
  * Procedure should be neutral - draw lots if can


# Necessity and  Variants

Affirmative Defenses: i did it but...

Common law rule: cannot use t his as excuse for killing

Necessity: justification
  * did it but morally right
  * and natural forces
Duress: excuse
  * did it, but not to blame
  * because there were human forces that caused this
  
ex) Necessity
Appraoch To Necessity (Model Penal Code)
  * D believes needed to prevent harm to self/others
  * believe means reasonable belief (same as in remedial law)
  * harm prevented must be more than the harm commited
  * ex) I am saving 6 lives and only 1 life taken
  * this applies to harming them,  but still not killing
  * no legislative intent against saving
  * defendant couldn't have created risk

Appraoch to Duress
ex)
  * Gun to someones head
  * im going to shoot you unless you shoot the other person
  * d believes threat to self/others is real
  * must be reasonable belief
  * threat must be immediate (not im going to come in and shoot you)
  * cannot be avenue for escape (no alternative)
  * D did not recklessly put self in this situation
