# Village of Skokie v Natl Socialist Party of America
(Skokie v Nazis)

What general area of law?
* First Ammendment

# First Amendment
"Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech"

How does it operate?

At the start, it was not very strong nor protective. In the 1900s, it became much stronger because there were sedition acts (due to communism) that people fought.

Arguments for allowing speech:
* Power: power is dangerous and there must be constraints
	* Allowing speech allows minority points of view from being heard
	* Allows people to speak out when power gets abused
	* It's not always clear which view points are best. We should be able to discuss all of them to figure out which ones are best.
* Art, science, truth(?), morality(?)
	* Subjective to debate and often challenge things as we know them.
* Expression and individual liberty
	* Who is to tell us what we can and cannot say
* Social Cohesion
	* Other people embrace ideas overtime that are positive ideas. We have come to this on our own accord. The figuring it out for oruselves is good.
* Airing and deflecting dangerous ideas / people
	* Keeping actual "bad" things underground supresses it and doesn't let us keep our eyes on it.
* Corrective - Counter speech
	* Allows us to refute other perspectives
	ex) bad idea see's others criticize and the re-asses their position

Sometimes this free speech and expression can be Discomforting. It's something we must accept.

## How to read a case
* Facts
	* Depend on what area of the law concerns us
* Prior Proceedings
	* Many of these cases have been heard and are on appeal. What have the past decisions been? What's been dismissed? How did this appeal happen.
* Issue
	* What is the specific thing being argued in the case at hand?
* Decision
	* Can be binary
* Reasons
	* Judges must give justifications for their decisions
	* Designed to inform the public and checking that the court is behaving in a reasonable way
* Remarks/Thoughts
	* What areas were left unaddressed? What might be a problem for a future case?

# Skokie

* Facts
	* Who
		* Nationalist Socialist Party of America and Frank Collins
			* Patterned themselves in Nazi word and dress 
			* Wanted to march peacefull in front of Skokie town hall?
			* How did they want to march? As Nazis. Military Uniforms, with Swastizaks and Flags, hand out materials about beliefs which were predjeduce against Jews and Blacks
		* Town of Skokie
			* Suburb in Chicago which is heavily Jewish (40,500/70,000)
			* 5-7k holocaust survivors living here
			* Concerns?
				* Worried about psychic harm to population
				* Violence (counter protest)
			
	* Some extra facts
	Current Suit
		* Collins sent a letter to town about march. Protesting the cost of his permit for the original march.
		* The permit cost so much because the town needed to make sure it was safe since it was a controversial march (police force, traffic)
		* Skokie sued to enjoin certain conduct during march

	Other Suits:
		* Collins suing Skokie in federal Courts for other stuff

	Enacted May 2, 1977 in response to his planned march
		* Ordinace 995 - Permrit required for 50 persons AND skokie official must certify "the assembely will not portray criminality, depravity or lack of virtue in, or incite violence, hatred, abuse or hostitility towrard a person or group of persons by reason of reference to religious, racial, ethnic, national or regional affiliation"
	
Could this ordinacne be applied to more benign speech that the govt might not like?
For example, the national or regional affilitation. What if it was protest against red/blue? Could this ordinace stop that type of protest?

Ordinance 995 - Prohibits dissemination of any materials within Skokie that incite hatred against person by reason of race, national origin, or religion, and is intened to do so.

Pro-life v Pro-choice. Many people say this is a religious based issue. If someone objected to the religion based argument, would that stop them from a Pro-choice march?

Ordanice 996 - Prohibits public demonstrations by members of political parties while wearing "military-style" uniforms.

But is this prohibiting expression? What about military style fashion?

These ordanices are passed to prevent Frank Collins from marching.
