# Swimming Pool Case

# Litigation Formulat and Settlement

* pi calculation for suit: `Pr * J > Cpi`
  * Pr = probability of a judgement
  * J = Judgement $ for pi (plaintiff)
  * Cpi = pi's (plaintiffs) litigation costs

When would a pi settle?

When the settlement higher than the return from going to court:
`Pr * J - Cpi <= S` (lhs is return from going to court)

Whats the lowest settlement they would take?
  * When `Pr * J - Cpi = S`

From the defendent perspective:

How much does it cost if hit with lawsuit?
  * don't get anything in return, just paying
  
Pr = Prob of judgement
J = Judgements $ for pi
Cdelta = delta (defendants) litigation costs

Cost to defendant: `Pr*J + Cdelta`

When would a defendent settle?
  * When settlement is less than the cost of going to court
  * `Pr*J + Cdelta >= S`

Highest delta S? 
  * No more than the cost of going to court
  * `Pr*J + Cdelta = S`

Going into litigation, there is **information asymmetry** so both parties might have inaccurate estimates in the formulas
Types of asymmetry:
  * Costs
  * Law - what law applies? what rules work? whats trending? jurisdiction? who's the judge?
  * Chances of Wins/Loss - hard to know
  * Risk appetitite - how much is a party willing to roll the dice?
  * $$ Damages

Defandants might have experience in estimating the costs
A plaintiff might have higher costs that the defendant doesn't know about

Having been a defandant or plaintiff in a space saves cost for that party because you are more efficient

These terms have lots of uncertainity built in to them

Risk appetitie example:
  * environmentalist group might be willing to incurr the cost for a public cause
  * cigarette groups dont want to set precedence of settling
  * some people like to gamble
      
Court procedures are designed to reduce information asymmetry
  * to drive people out of court and into settlement


What procedures might help with asymmetry?

* Pleadings
  * initial docs made to court identifying claims
* Bargaining
  * court requires parties meet for potential settlement
* Discovery
  * court formatted turning over evidence between parties
* Court system actions
  * costs as parties move up pyramid

# Grievance Pyramid

No looking at litigation

Step 1: Pleadings
  * Plaintiffs **complaint**
    * whats the rule of substantive law on which plaintiff founds her complaint?
In the swimming pool case:
"VIII. That sole and proximate cause of said injuries was the negligence of the defandant in the following particulars, to wit:"

Doctrine

Negligent Defendant Pays:
Four elements:
  * duty
  * breach
  * causation
  * harm (injury)

Complaint must set out facts to support each element

Side note: fed court asks for a short plain statement of complaint and use "plausibility pleading" which articulates that you have facts that support claim

# Duty? Breach?

(a) In **misleading the plaintiff** as to the depth...
(b) In **failing to warn the plaintiff** that the bottom was not constructed in the same manner as other swimming pools...
(c) In **failing to properly care for the plaintiff** by calling a doctor and ambulance...

# Cause

That the **sole and proximate cause of said injuries** was the negligence of the defandant in the following pariculars...

# Injury (harm)

...the plaintiff's neck was crushed, broken and dislocated; the ligaments, muscles and soft tissues were torn and stretched; her head was cut to a length necessarily requiring 14 stiteches...

# Contributory Negligence Concern

... and dived in the pool at the side, gauging the depth of the water and the point where she dived in by the position at the top of the water on the bodies of her friends standing toghether in the pool at the point near the center...

The plaintiff reasonably assumed that the depth of the water in the pool was the same from side to side in accordance with the types of construction used generally in the construction of swimming pools...

This is added to show that she was not negligent.

# Purpose of Complaint?

* State system (OR)
  * Set out main facts
  * set out main issues of law through the factual pleadings
  * Put defendant (and court) on notice
    * of the dispute
    * of basic legal rule
    * of plaintiffs identity 
    * of the relief sought

Why not more than that?
  * its early
  * all the facts may not be fleshed out

Side note: fed system through FRCP Plausibility pleading

# Defendants Response

Demurrer Response: Defandant demurs to the complaint on the ground that it fails to sate a cause of action on which relief can be granted

Standard? Even if plaintiff's facts are true, no legal claim exists (no connection between incident and the duty)
Purpose? Early test if valid legal claim -- efficient 
Judge or Jury? Who determines if legal valid claim? Judges make legal determinations (jurys make factual determinations. Judge grants/denys demur

Side note: Federal equivlalent is a 12(b)(6) Motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim

ex)
student whose vacation plans were spoiled has sued to end summer homework in wisconsin, claiming it creates an unfair workload and unnecessary tests
lined up dream camp counselor job, but  honors pre-calculus homework turned his summer into a headache
larson and his father sued
Court throws this out because no legal claim

# Demurrer Outcome

Court struck claim (c) (failing to properly care for plaintiff)
  * there was no duty of care owed to call an ambulance

# Defendants Response

**Denies the allegations** (ann is a minor and P is her guardian)
Affirmative defense on contributory negligence: **caused by her own carelessness and negligence**

Claims obvious signs that it was shallow

# Discovery

Obtain the facts/evidence (both sides) needed in the case
Obligated to provide other sides with information that pertain to the suit

FRCP 26(b): parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is **relevant** to any party's claim or defense
  * does not need to be admissible

Ann entitled to  anything relevant to construction of pool and signs
Pool company entitled to information pertaining to her behavior
  * how often went to mt scott
  * is she inclined to be careless
  * injured before?
  * pre-existing injuries?

What if claim brought that has 0% winning but enough to survive demurr?
  * The defendant needs to allocate resources away from business to give plaintiff information they have
  * because of this, there is some criticism of the discovery phase allowing wide range of information that can be requested
  * this creates an insentive to cause defendants to settle
  * however, this is counter balanced that a little person can take on a big entity


# Steps so Far
* Injury - grevience
* Settlement Offer (2000) rejected
* Complaint (plaintif)
* Demurrer (Defendant) [12(b)(6) failure to state a claim)
* Court ruling
* Answer (defendant)
* Reply (plaintiff)
* Discovery
* Next step: Summary Judgement (not in this case)

# Summary Judgement

Motion usually made by defendant

Test for Summary Judgement
  * No genuine issue about material facts
  * viewing facts in light most favoring non-mover
  * party is entitled to a judgement as a matter of law

In plain terms: facts agreed on and no reasonable pereson could find for the other side

Different from Demurrer bc
  * not claiming failure for state of action
  * failure of having facts that show cause of action can be proven in court

The timing of this:
  * facts are presented
  * we don't disagree on the facts
  * even if you look at the facts that help the plaintiff the most, they will still loose
  
How might be applied to this case (if it occured in oregon)
  * No genuine issue about material facts?
    * Not the case
    * were the signs clear
    * was her behavior reasonable?
    * was the pool construction unreasonable?

Two legal issues?
  * Negligence on part of pool owner
  * Contributory negligence on part of Ann Brown
