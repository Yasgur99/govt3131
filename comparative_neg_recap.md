# Comparative Neglegence Recap

Change contributory to compartive negligence

# Hypos to Go Beyond Loach
Davies v. Mann
Loach v. RR

Both cases have outcome and prior rule
Courts sense insentives and fairness didn't work with the prior rule 
Courts want to the plaintiff to be able to recover

A good defense lawyer can always find a way to place *some* blame on the plaintiff

Davies v. Mann - if negligent at all, they get nothing.
But what if it was Mann v. Davies?

The court wants the wagon owner to have to pay because 
  * wagon owner should be careful
  * wagon owner is at more fault than person at side of road

If its contributory negligence, donkey owner looses because they left donkey on side of road so some fault

Under the last clear chance rule, would the case come out the same way if plaintiff/defendant flipped?
  * Plaintiff always looses

Loach v. RR

Self created incapacity rule fixes last clear chance
Load sues RR -> plaintiff can recover because LCC railroad had defective breaks -> had no chance to recover -> self created incapacity lets plaintiff win
If RR v Loach, would the case come out the same way?
  * RR should have breaks that work
  * RR always looses

LCC Rule fixes C/N
SCI Rule Fixes LCC

The court now wants to aportion blame based on how negligent each party was

Doctrine after these cases:
Negligent defendant pays unless (Butterfield) plaintiff was contributory negligent except (Davies v. Mann) last clear chance to avoid or defendant has SCI or Plaintiff has SCI (Loach v RR)

This doctrine is being done by the jury or the judge

# State Negligence Types

Pure Comparitive (P award reduced by Ps blame)
  * inequitble to get full amount if responsible for portion of damages
  * exists in 12 states

Modified Comparative (P awarded only if P less and/ore equal blame)
One Flavor: (similiar to contributory negligence with some comparative)
  * if P below 50%, P gets 0$  else P gets $ - P%blame
  * lets equally responsible people sue
  * 11 states
Another flavor:(similiar to contributory negligence with some comparative)
  * if `P <= 50%` then P gets 0 else P gets $-P%blame
  * 23 states

4 states + DC still use Contributory negligence (Negligent P gets 0)
