# Grievance Pyramid

Courts serve purpose for dispute resolution. Not all resolutions happen in court


Appeal (Top of pyramid)
  * if you dont like the decision, you could settle
  * or you can continue to challenge in the appelate court
  * and if the apeal isnt going well you can still settle
Judgement
  * if you didnt settle in litigation the judge/jury gives a decision
Litigation
  * but if you can't settle
  * then you file a lawsuit
  * you can decide to settle here too
Dispute
  * alternative dispute resolution (outside the court) -> a settlement
  * if not we must make a legal claim
Claim
  * if you make a claim to them are you satisfied
Grievance
  * If you get injured do you accept the greivence
  * or do you make a claim
Injurious experience
  * sometimes we dont avoid harm
  * we hope the harm doesn't cause an injury (nonperception of injury)
  * if we do get injured, we hope to fix it ourselves (self help)
Human experience (Bottom of pyramid)
  * expected to behave reasonably
  * we try and avoid harm

Theres always the opportunity to settle. The cost and time pressures people to move out of the court and into settlements 

# Brown v Hayden Island Amusment Co.

Facts:
* Portland, Oregon
* Pools
    * 19 Public pools (including Mount Scott pool)
    * Claim that Mount Scott is the example of a reasonable pool owner when putting up signage for a public pool
* Defendant
    * Hayden Island Amusment Company
    * Jantzen Island Amusment Park (owned and operated by Hayden Island Amusment Company)
      * 4 pools
      * 2 wating, 1 deep, 1 shallow
      * Well marked with different deepnesses
* Sharon Ann Brown
  * 15 years old with friends
  * Experienced swimmer and diver (usually went to Mt. Scott)
  * Dives into shallow pool from the side (sides more shallow than center)
  * Breaks neck and hospitalzed for 31 days

# Back to the Grevience Pyramid

Human experience - swimming with friends
Injurious experience - breaks neck
Grevience: specific against the pool and company
  * pool did not do enough to protect Ann Brown
  * Result was injury
Grievance and Role of Attorney
  * Mr. Stiner an attorney said the pool company should legally provide compensation (30% contigency - attorney agrees to put upfront costs but get % if win the case)
  * American system (own costs to pay attorney)
    * Lawyers can police the system by only pursuing valid claims
    * Contingency helps people who dont have resources can get into system (equalizer)
Dispute
  * Pool company says adequate warning signs making depth obvious
    * Ann dove head first and knew better
    * Why? Contributory Negligence - if she was negligent, pool has to pay nothing
      * Affirmative defense in OR - must alert court up front 
  * Ann Brown says 
    * Not like other pools in the area (why does this matter?)
      * Uses Mt. Scott pool to say what is reasonable
    * Unclear signs about depth
      * The pool has a duty to be reasonable with their signs
Settlement?
  * 2000$ - Pool company says no
  * Pool thinks case will not get into system because of contributory negigence

# Case Filings and Trials (Civil)

Civil filings much higher in quantity compared to criminal trials
In 1970-1988, there is exponential increase in civil filings
But a decreasing percentige of cases end up in trial
  * pyramid pressures cases out of the system

# Litigation Formula and Settlement

* pi calculation for suit:
  * Pr = probability of a judgement
  * J = Judgement $ for pi
  * Cpi  = pi's litigation costs
  * Calculation: `Pr * J > Cpi`
  * ex) 40 % chance to win 100$. Litigation costs must be less than 40$

Uncertainty in this model:
  * how do u know what your litigation costs are and what the payout would be and what the percenage is up front?
