# Grove City College v. Bell

Government Funding and Private Actors

There are civil rights acts passed by congress that:
  * individuals that engage in economic activity of vertain size subject to provisions that sound like equal protection
  * so the 14th and 5th arent applied, but legislation that does the same thing is applied
  * 14th section 5 + commerce clause = gives federal govt ability to do so

Facts:

* private liberal arts college
* religous based
* ranked 114
* $18k tuition
* 2.3k students
* Proud of providing education without govt funding or mandates
  * gives them ability to not have to follow rules in return for taking money
* Students took money from BEOG (Pell grants) and Basic Educational Opportunity grants
* Title IX
  * prohibits sex discrimination in "any education program or activity recieving Federal financial assistance"

Issues:
  * does Title IX apply to Grove City if it takes no federal $$, but students do?
  * If Title IX does apply are there limits to how it applies?

Prior Procedure:
  * Dept of Ed determined Grove City getting fed $$
  * Dept of Ed responsible for overseeing Title IX and requested  "Assurance of Compliance" letter
  * Grove City refused to sign bc didnt believe recieving fed funds
  * Dept of Ed filed before Admin Law Judge, Held:
    * Grove City getting fed $$
    * Ordered Grove City to sign Assurance of Compliance
    * Or stop $$ to students until college signs
  * College and 4 Students (who were denied grants) sued in district court, Held:
    * BOEGs are fed $$ to college
    * But - Dept of Ed. cannot terminate student aid
  * 34d Cir - reversed
    * Fed $$ to college
    * But they can terminate student aid

# Grove City and gender discrimination

  * no evidence of gender discrimination

Why wont GC sign?
  * Must agree to comply with Title IX ... And all applicable requirements imposed by or pursuant to... 
  * Title IX is big and has lots of reqirements beyond gender discrimination
  * "Dedication to the freedom of the individual"

# Goes to supreme court

* Getting federal $? Yes
  * "receiving Federal financial assistance" does not differentiate direct or through students
* Dept of Ed can terminate BOEGs?
  * pending signature  on assurance of compliance they can
  * Stop taking money and do as you please if you dont want to comply

# Public Education

Equal protection: "nor deny to a ny person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."
No civil rights act until 1964

Segregation in the states with respect to private actors is common
State governments also did segregation

# Plessy v Ferguson (1896)

Facts:
  * Rule that said if you AA, you cant ride on RR cars, must ride in back of train
  * Homer Plessy 1/8th black, looked white
  * Sat in non-black car
  * Announced that he was black
  * Removed from car
  * Argue: to remove him from car was violation of equal protection

Supreme Court:
  * equal protection doesn't mean together
  * sufficient if seperate but equal accomodations
  * own car in back is seperate and equal because can get from point A to point B
  * Note: this is example of court reflecting attitudes of majority at the time with respect to race


Thurgood Marshall and NAACP challenge seperate but equal
  * picked cases to make it obvious to court that it was wrong
  * Murray v Pearson - man who wanted UMaryland Law but turned down 
    * cant offer someone admission out of state (not seperate but equal)
  * Sweat v Painter - Wanted admission to UT Law
    * UT created new law school in texas and said he could go there
    * Argued its not equal to go to law school in Austin vs Houstin because Houstin does not have the same law "recources"/jobs in the area
    * Court agrees
  * Mclaren v Oklahoma - Applied for grad degree UOklahoma
    * UOk only agrees to admit after court order
    * Says you can come but you cant sit in classroom with students
    * Sues and result is even within same building, its not an equal education
    * Court agrees


# Court in Brown (1954 - Topeka)

Challenge:
  * Challenge Plessy head on in K-12
  * All prior cases at graduate level
  * Less threatning to challenge adult integration vs children integration
    * Much larger social challenge

Goal: want to show the social problems in the country
  * using young child is going to capture hearts and minds
  * brown family selected intentionally
  * dad = minister
  * little girl well put together

Schools seperate by race k-12
Clark Test: social science evidence children in N vs S choose best doll (all chose white doll), evidence of keeping children seperate

Holding:
  * Not express overrule of Plessy
  * But Seperatte CANNOT be equal
  * in the school context

Equal Protection in Education:
  * narrow tailoring & government compelling interest in edu context:
    * remedying effects of intentional discrimination
    * pursuing diversity in higher education

After brown, schools must integrate
But there is enormous social pushback
  * ex) little rock school district refuses to integrate
    * governer refuses so eisenhower sends troops to  make sure it happens
  * ex) alabama governor blocks school doors not letting children in


Issues Today:
  * DC vs Falls Church Public Schools
    * DC is mainly white
    * FSPS is maily white
    * Cant use one school district to correct problem in another district
    * Cant force people in city A to send children to city B (black areas vs white areas)

# Serrano v. Priest (1971)

Sould education be tied to equal protection clause?

Facts:
  * LA County Public Schools financed on property taxes
  * LA County is big and has wide range of socioeconomic status
    * Baldwin Park (poor) vs Beverly Hills (rich)
  * Baldwin student spending was very low in comparison

Challenge: 
  * Like situated people, members of LA county, treated differntley based on how wealthy/proeprty tax
  * Education itself should be fundamental right under equal protection
  * Challenge is that there is no reason to differntiate based on wealth
  * Holding: wealth is a suspect class and education is fundamental, therefore strict scrutny should apply
  * Holding did not last long because something similiar appealed to fed court and says education is not fundamental

# Rodriguez v San Antonio School District

* Edgewood TX predomanantly latino
* Uses property based tax school system
* Alamo Heights predomantly white
* Also used property tax school system
* Alamo much more wealthy
* Supreme court says:
  * Poverty is not suspect classification AND public education is not a fundamental right
  * Therefore, strict scrutiny not triggered
  * All state needs to do is satify rational-basis test (to be allowed by equal protection)
  * Therefore property tax-funding scheme is constitutional

Issues: Equal Protection/Fundamental right
  * poverty is not a fundamental class
  * education not fundamental right 

Holding and Reasons:
* Wealth not a suspect class (why not?)
  * How do you define different subcategories (where are cutoff points)?
  * Race and ethnicity has clear definition
  * Certain income in NYC vs certain income in north dakota could be same but its more expensive to live in NYC
  * Income? Gross Income? Net Income? What about people who make alot but spend a lot? 
  * What about lower level of income but owns property

  * Are you being denied education based on wealth?
    *  What about poor that live in wealthy districts
    *  Even in poor districts you still get an education

  * Education is not a fundamental right (why not)?
    * Different from other fundamental rights (speech)?
    * Speech is our engagement in expression
    * Education is the government's duty to provide to you without violation of equal protection
    * One is provision of benefit, one is infraction of a right
    * Once you're prevented of speaking, that right is gone
    * You can always access the education, you're just demanding a kind of education
    * Provision vs infraction
    * Also, if we extend fundamental rights to education, what else becomes fundamental?
      * Court becomes political actor if they expand fundamental rights about social policy

# Chicago City and IL State

Education quality and its connection to finance
More money != better education
Small religious schools are providing high level of education
