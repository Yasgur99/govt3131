# Swimming Pool Trial

Facts as Sharron see it:
* Walks past waiting pool
* Says tiles were not easily visible (claims were faded)
* friends were chest deep in middle signified deep
* made a safe kind of dive (45 degree angle)

Facts as Jantzen Beach see it:
* walks past tiles that say 2ft
* produced evidence that tiles get repained every year
* Hand rails are part of series of visual signs indicating shallow
  * There are steps, waterfountains, shallow signs
* The pool right next to it has a diving board, this one did not
* Stitches on top of head (refute diving at 45 degree angle)

# Directed Verdict Motion

Pool company makes a montion for a voluntary nonsuit

Occurs after evidence presented, but before jury deliberated
  * asks judge to make decision instead of jury
Test for motion to be granted:
  * No reasonable jury (after viewing evidence in light most favorable to opponent)
  * would have a legal sufficient evidentiary basis to find support for the other side
In plain terms: facts so overwhelming no rasonable jury could find for the standard

Why do we have this motion? Why such a Deferential standard (in favor of send to jury)?
  * Protects outcome from jury that might actually be unreasonable but it must be very obvious

Most judges will send to jury regadless because judges don't want to be overturned on appeal for acting on jurys province
Also, the jury is already here and has made the effort and spent the time

Outcome in this case: Judge denies defendants motion

# Judges Instructions

Guide to jury as to the legal definitions
  * usually read out of a book
  * negotiated by both parties

Sets out the legal issues
  * Negligence - defendant
  * Contributory Negligence - plaintiff

Burdens of proof
  * Main Claim - Pool company negligent
    * Burden belongs to Sharon
  * Affirmative Defense
    * Pool company saying no you are contributory negligent belongs to defendant

Burden of proof is by a preponderance of evidence (> 50 %)

Judge explains to jury these standards and gives these informal instructions (uncommon to do so)
  * P Must act
    * Like a "reasonably prudent person of her age and experience"
    * Under same/similiar circumstances
Plaintiff objects says he wants it to be a "reasonably prudent 14 year old girl"
  * Doesn't want her experience to be a part of it
  * the 14 year old can be expected to behave a bit less reasonably unless they are doing adult activity (like driving heavy machine on a farm)
  * Also depends if you are an expert in an area (ie a pilot should act according to their training)

  * D Must act
    * As a reasonbly prudent person under the same/similiar circumstances
    * Reasonable care to warn P
    * Make pool area safe is known or reasonably should know of danger

Contributory Negligence Effect
  * No recovery for P if found
  * Judge says, "Now, thats just a nice way of saying that if both were at fault in the batter... Then there could be no recovery"
    * This is a problem because if you decide D not at fault, did you need to find some kind of recovery?
    * D attorney objects and corrects himself about what that might mean

# Jury Verdict

Finds for plaintiff $10,000

Standard for jury: preponderance of evidence that D was negligent and P was not contributory negligent

The defendent motion to set aside the verdict:
  * Same motion as before
  * No reasonable jury (viewing evidence in light most favorable to opponent) would have a legally sufficient evidentary basis to find for the other side
  * Court accepts because she was overwhelmingly contributorily negligent

Why did the judge grant after the jury?
  * Judges like this better than before the judgement because a decision has been made 
  * even though they don't love to use it

# Appeal Scenario

Purpose of Appeals

Sharron Ann brown appeals to set aside the verdict since she one in front of the jury

Appleate court now hears based on a legal standard
  * they just get the transcript

Reason for appeals: legal uniformity and error correction
Trial judges are a single individual (sole arbiter)
Outcomes may vary from one judge to a next
Appelate (intermediate) level (3 justices) look at the decision made by trial court
The 3 check that the law is being applied uniformly across the jurisdiction

Outcome of appeal?
Defendant still not liable

BUT trial court thought plaintiff contrib negligent
Appelate court thought defendant was not unreasonable
