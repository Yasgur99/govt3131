# What is Public Benefit

Something the govt provides to publc

ex) 
* Parks (local and national)
* highways
* Many utilities and basic necessity
  * water
* art
* security (police, military, army, etc)
* libraries
* education

Also give benefit through financial assistance
ex)
* student loans
* unemployment
* healthcare
* food stamps
* housing
* farmers, cheese makers, ect. get subsidies for production (agricultural subsidies)

# How to we pay for all of this?

* Taxes
* Toll roads
* metro cards
* lotto
* sin taxes (cigarettes, gas, alcohol, etc.)
* property taxes (makes the most $$ for govt)

# Why is it so hard to cut spending

* entrenched interests (private and govt)
  * hard to tell a community govt is taking it back
  * ex) taking away military base
* political consequences for legislators
* endowment effect of recipients
  * once delivered, this is the new baseline of what govt should provide

# Is everyone netiled to access a benefit

* they are "public"
* but not everyone gets every benefit
* often are means/characteristic tested: public housing, food stamps, educational assistance, medical assistance, age, need, student loans
* ex) social security: age

# Equal Protection

14th A: "Nor shall any state ... deny to any pereson within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws"

Implies when there are laws we should be treated equally
Only applies to states

5th A: "No person shall be ... deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law ..."

Nothing about 5th talks about equal protection

No equal protection at federal level

How does the fed govt solve this problem?

Bolling v Sharpe (1954)
  * constitutionally desegregate DC schools
  * fed govt controls school (because DC not a state)
  * shouldn't be deprived of liberty - includes education
  * discrimination based on race is part of liberty
  * due process isnt truly due process unless equal protection exists through liberty component


Rule for all govt action:
  * cannot be arbitrary when providing benefits/instituting laws
  * cannot be invidious (against single group) for denial of benefits/protection
  * if you have similiar situated people, they must be treated similiar

Relevant questions
  * who is govt acting against/for
  * how good a reason

# Levels of Scrutiny

Who does govt action impact?
For what reason does govt act

US v. Carolene Products - Filled Milk Act
  * required no oil fillers
  * only can use milk fat
  * this restriction didnt apply to other dairy manufacturers (only milk producers)
  * carolene claims violation of equal protection
  * Decision: butter vs milk is not the same because govt had rational reason for differentionating

From this decision:

3 teirs of scrutiny
  * rational basis
    * applies to all govt action
  * intermediate
    * applies to gender
  * strict
    * applies to govt treating people different

This means govt can sometimes discriminate
  * just depends on who those people are
  * just cant treat similiar situated different
  * ex) must be 21 to buy alc
  * ex) property owner discrimination (CA Coastal Trail - must provide public access if on property)
  * ex) wind in the hair discrimination - must wear helmet when riding motorcycle

The court asks: is this law rationally related to legitimate govt purpose
  * and not treating similiar groups different

However, we are skeptical of certain groups of people treating different
ex) race, religion, ethnicity

It's not to say the govt can't, but the govt needs a really good reason

Also more scrutiny if limiting some fundamental right (speech, voting, etc)
  * but its possible
  * ex) age

Idea: Strict scrutiny - narrowly tailored to advance a compelling govt interest
  * if govt wants to differentiate, they need a compelling govt interest
  * the law must be very targeted to that compelling govt interest
  * if the court applying strict scrutiny, govt often looses
  * standard is so high


# Intermediate Scrutiny

* categories where there  may be some reason to treat people different
* even though general assumption is no difference
* often applied to gender

Many states have provided protections for LGBTQ because federal law doesn't protect as well

ex) public subsidies for car insure costs based on age/gender
  * males statistically more reckless as females driving
  * men insurance costs more

Restrooms: potty parity laws
  * case: giving same # bathrooms for men and women = discrimination
    * because women take longer than men to go
  * decision: (chutkow didnt say)
  
ex) Restrictions on women in military
  * acceptable to set standards that say you have to meet physical/fitness standards
    * ex figher pilot or firefighter
  * but not okay to say men only

Itermediate Scrutinary: substantially related to an important govt interest

i.e. if you are going to differntiate based gender (at birth) then that differentiation must be substantially related

# Conferral

Court's Role:
  
  * statute's rules are followed
  * constitutional rules are followed
    * constitutional provisions
      * did congress have power to pass this law (articulated power)
      * who gets things (cant improper discrimination) 
      * who pays (cant have improper burdens)


Some other questions:
  * can fed govt order states to take action
    * ex) speed limit = 65, drinking age = 21; does state need to enforce?
  * no, the fed govt cant do this
  * fed laws are supreme laws, but 10th a says fed govt cannot order states to take action
  * instead of ordering, the fed govt pays (or doesn't pay) states depending if they enforce
    * ex if state enforces speed limits, we will give you $$ to maintain highways
