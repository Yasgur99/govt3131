# Criminal Affirmative Defenses

Necessity and Duress

Shipwreck - necessity defense (natural casues)
  * justification (did it, but not morally wrong)
Common law rule: cannot use necessity defense for murder

But Model Penal Code (MPC) is a suggestion provided to states and fed govt

MPC allows necessity as defense for murder provided criteria hit

Duress (human causes)
  *  excuse (did it, but not to blame)

Affirmative Defenses:
  Assertion by defendant why they should not be punished

# Insanity Defense

Did it, but characteristics of defendent mean not to blame

# Why have an Insanity Defense?

Retribution
Utilitarinism

Insanity defense does not fit well under retribution or utilitarinism

ex)
Ted Cusinsky (unibomber)
Brilliant mathematitian 
Mentally ill
Fell off the grid after being professor living at shack in Montana
He would write manifestos on how world ought to operate
Believed he needed to send bombs to people who are industrializing society

People are getting killed or injured because of the bombs
Federal govt activated because bombs cross state lines
Sent manifesto to NYT (and some other papers)
NYT publishes the manifesto in hopes someone recognizes thoughts in it so authorities could identify him
His brother David knows of his mental struggles
David goes to FBI and says he needs them to promise no death penalty in return for turning him in
Currently spending life in supermax

Judge ended up finding him competant to stand trial

Retribution: moral blame?
  * is there moral blame for someone who doesn't understand moral norms

Utilitarianism: deterrence?
  * assumes rational thought but his cost/benifits are not rational
  * how much deterrence are we going to get

Utilitarianism: social protection and prison?
  * yes but,
  * is this someone who is best served by prison

Utilitarianism: rehab and prison?
  * need mental illness help in prison

Problem: crafting an insanity test that works
  * twinkies defense
    * ate too many twinkies caused depression and depression caused him to commit murder

Some tests we use:

# Durham Test

still exists, not used often

Defendant excused if conduct was product of mental disease or defect

Problem: very broad definition
How do you define mental disease or defact
  * need DR testimony / pursuasive argument
  * relying on defendant takes role away from reasonable jurers
  * what happens if two DRs have opposing views?

# Irrestible Impulse

excuses criminal conduct that is the result of a delusional compulsion or overpowering urge, when that compulsion was brought about by mental disease

Has components of Durham
But adds that it happend because impossibe to control themselves

Used alot by serial killers and pedophiles

ex)
Dahmer
  * lure young men into appt
  * kill, dismember, and consume
  * after captured and incarcerated, did interviews with his father who presented inability to hold himself back from killing
  * Did not successfuly use the  irrestible impulse argument
Ted Bundy
  * Killing spree from west coast to flordia
  * psociopathic
  * compulsion/need to murder/torture women
  * defended himself
  * convicted
  * refused to make insanity defense

Problems with test:
  * its a sliding scale
  * long periods of time not engaged in murderous conduct
  * both of the men had jobs and interacted with public
  * when is it irresistable vs dont want to control

# M'Naghten Rule

Used by majority of states today

* clearly proved that at time of commiting act
* party accuesed was laboring under such defect of reason from disease of the mind (good dr)
* as to not know that the nature and quality of the act he was doing
* or if he did know it that he did not what he was doing was wrong

Version 1: cannot understand nature and quality of act:
ex)
someone thought they were squeezing lemons
but it was a young child's neck
had no idea because in delusional state

ex) 
someone using a hedge trimmer to trim rose bushes
it wasn't a bush, it was his wife
did not know it was his wife bc delusion

Version 2: cannot understand wrongfullness of act
ex)
dana willis
driving in desert with son
believes car swarmed by spiders and tarantualas (delusion)
took son, ran into cold desert, stripped sons clothing to get bugs off
15 month old son who died of hypothermia
prosecuted and used M'Naghten successfully

# Model Penal Code 

(not an actual statute)

but many states have adopted it

An individual is not liable from criminal offenses if
when he or she commited the crime or crimes,
the individual suffered from a mental diseas or defect
that resulted in the individual lacking the substancial capacity to appreciate the wrongfullness of his or her actions
or to conform his or her actions to requirements under the law

Which is similiar:
DR says they have mental diseas (good dr)
lacking capacity to appreciate wrongfulness (mnaughten)
  * modifies mnaughten by adding substantial capacity instead of could not
  * some more wiggle room for the defendant
to conform his or her actions to requiremetns under law
  * irrestible impulse test

21 states use this MPC form
But most states use Mnagten

# Insanity Defense in the News

Why is it such a difficult defense to use?

the burden of proof is on the defendent
its hard to prove what the test requires
especially when judges/juries are sceptical (because this defense is an excuse)
  * often puts thumb on scale against defense

ex)
patrina welch
durham test
successfully used defense
jumped off roof with 4 mo old twins
because she thought men were in the house to murder them
case involved a mother: we see it easier to use insanity defense for mothers killing children
  * because why else would they kill their children?

ex)
Chris Kyle
American Sniper case
Kyle had PTSD from military
Chris took Eddie Ray Routh to shooting range
Rough shoots and kills chad littlefield and Kyle
Routh fails using insanity defense (mnoughten)

ex)
James Holmes case
obsessed with batman/joker
went to the movies in military gear
shot up the audience, multiple dead
tries to use mnoughten
fails and gets 12 life sentences plus 3,318 years
understood he was shooting theatre
tried to evade police

ex)
slenderman case
3 young girls were 12
girls believed in slenderman
slenderman could harm family
in order to prevent that, you need to make sacrifice and family would be protected
2 of the girls kill the third girl with a kitchen knife
found with knife and duffle bag
tried as adults in adult court because so bad
Morgan Geyser pled guilty and avoided trial
Anissa Weier claimed insanity defense
insanity defense sucessfull
  * brain is not fully formed to understand reality
  * understood what she did, but
  * 12 y/o couldnt understand what she was doing was wrong
  * believed if she didnt do this her family would be tortured
Sentenced 25 years in mental health prison
