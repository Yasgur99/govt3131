# Intro to Admin State

Executive branch executives with society through regulation, info, benefits

Can do this by inherent powers or legislation

Admin State has expanded over time
  * via agencies that carry out legislation

Not what many of our founders had in mind

After new deal and FDR (need for intervention to help with market crash)
  * legislation passed to give executive branch power to help
  * this starts growth of admin state

# Is the Administrative State Here Right now?

* Covid regulations
* OSHA
  * all sorts of guidance to workers saftey and health standards
  * informational mechanism
* FED Reserve
  * Independent agency
  * Members appointed by pres, approved by senate, then terms exist beyond presedential term to give them independence
  * Many actions taken during covid 
    * planning to lend 1 trillion a day
    * purchasing treasury securities
    * doing these things to maintain liquidy
* Secretary of Trasury and IRS
  * Moved tax day to july 15
* CDC, HHS, Nat Inst Health
  * providing information
  * testing
  * vaccine research
* Homeland Security
  * Border and International Travel restrictions

The state level also has their own travel restrctions, business closures as a response to covid

Now pretending covid was not happening (how chutkow would normally present):

* FCC net neutrality, interference radio communications
* EPA manufacture and disposal of computers
  * used to need permit to dispose CRT computer monitor back in the day (now you can recycle)
* Commerce on software/hardware import/export
* Consumer Product Safty Commision
  * How things manufactured, what chemicals in it, what emmisions from new product (ex. carpets)
* OSHA regulates what type of carpets, under what conditions, how they can be installed
* if you wear contacts: fairness to contact lens users act
  * medical devices - you can buy them on the web instead of from a doctor
  * regulated by FDA on how manufactured, materials
  * FTC regulates how can be bought and sold
* If you have a credit card
  * Fed Reserve
  * Consumer Financial Protection Bereau -> you dont get price gauged on credit intrest
* Drivers licence
  * State regualtes what you can and cant do
  * restrictions on what time of day if young
  * what type of vehicle can you drive


Theres lots of agencies (AKA Alphabet Soup)
  * FBI
  * EPA
  * CIA
  * FAA
  * SEC
  * EEOC
  * FTC
  * FED
  * OSHA
  * NRC
  * FCC
  * CFPB
  * ...

Theres ~500 administrative agencies today
The federal register (new and proposed regulations) general upward trend

# Rules, Complexity, Rule of Law

Theres all these agencies and laws
We are expected to abide by the regualtions
But because theres so many of them how does this work?

ex) Affordable care act 2700 pages
ex) immigration bill and proposed amendments 1200 pages

In comparision the constitution is 4 pages

The point often argued is that this creates a rubric of legal oblications that are unknowble because there are so many of them and so complex
  * is this a due process problem?
  
# Policy Issues

Why do we need a regulatory state?

* burdenson
* expensive
* imposes restrictions
  * americans dont love restrictions

But on the plus side:

* We have an active market economy
  * walk into store and there are many options
  * we want to know those options are all safe
  * Can walk into hospital and there is a standard

Active market Problems:
  * traffic problems in LA
  * do we need people to come in and help people get from point a to b
  * love canal - why dont we have better behavior on behalf of industries? 
  * Children used to be in the workforce (now regulated)
  * Construction  - shoddy materials, not built right - create havoc later
  * Insanitary conditions when making food
  * Facebook and Google collecting data

These problems we want salved that might not be able to be addresed by private individuals that can be addressed by govt
We want activity to happen (build houses, manufacture, tech) but dont want it to be unsafe
Criminal law is a prohibition
Remidial law is backwards looking (repay for doing bad)
We want regulations on front end
Regulatory law prescribes ahead of time what can and cant happen

Why do we need regulatory state?

Sometimes we have market failures in the economy
  

* public as a consumer needs help
  * inadequate ability to protect against predatory/problematic behavior from larger industry
  * want that activity but want proactive prevention

Types of failures:
* inadequate information
  * some agencies provide information (ex CDC)
  * caloric and nutritional ingredients (FDA requires this now) 
  * cell phone billing was complex to figure out what paying for - now must be provided info
  * all these things would be hard to figure out independently
* external cost (externality)
  * cost and benifits not aligned 
  * ex) windmills are placed on state borders bc benefit of windimll to one state and negative state exporting to neighbing state
  * ex) pollution and acid rain - facility polutes air that drifts to another state - benefit  of manufacturing but no costs on pollution
  * if there is air  pollution, everyone would benefit for cleaning, but costs alot for someone to do it -> everyone else insentivied to wait
    * this is an example of free rider problems

Why does remedial work for air pollution?:
  * how big was the harm from an individual?
  * 100 people $10 cost
  * 1000 social injury
  * 500$ cost cleaner fuel
  * Assume still a profit
  * 1000$ harm - $5000 fix
  * Why no suit? 10$ cost is not worth it to many people to pay to fight

  * after the fact
  * cost of litigation (might not solve for other parties)
  * free rider (public goods)
  * information and proof
  * court doesn't know the right number of air particulates and how to balance profit/market
    
Why not criminal law solution?
  * due process problems
  * case by case prosecution (doesnt solve the problem on the whole)
  * after the fact (ex post)
  * they dont have best expertise in the area (prosecutors and judges)

Instead better solved by administrative state (ex acid rain):
  * EPA can study the problem
    * can decide the appropriate response
    * ex) change mix of fuel and add scrubbers in smoke stacks
  * Can set standards for air quality
    * can change them if they need to
    * can monitor how effective their changes are
    * dont need to wait for another law suit to make changes
  * Can monitor who breaks standards
  * Flexibility
    * Can change things based on how effective things are
    * harder in judicial system because must wait for a case
  * Government pays for the agency
    * gives everyoen the benifit and dispersing cost
    * the people who benefit are people who pay the cost

Another type of failure: Natural Monopolies

* often natural resources
* high barrier to entry
* these monopolies can charge whatever they want
* we see this with electricity, cell phone towers

What about private agreements between consumer and business?
  * have you tried to negotioate with big company -- wont work bc power disparity and no alternative

What about remedial litigation?
  * individual inscentives against suid
  * const v benifit
  * free rider problems
  * court capabilities - not courts  expertise
What about criminal law
  * same problems as remedia
  * objectional practices vs high prices
  * due process

Benefit of administrative instrumenet to set prices / access
  * gained experience with industry
  * can asses fixed costs, variabl costs, and return on capital
  * flexibility
  
Types of market failure: common pool problems
  * no (or limited) property rights
    * have peice of land. you can fence it in. easy to exclude other people.
    * common pool items are hard to do this
    * reduced inscentives to protect
    * hard to exclude others
    * often moves
  * once taken, not avalaible to others
  * Exploitation

ex) hard to catch a fox, call it your fox
  * so to say it belongs to you is hard
ex) water
  * i have homestead above water and put up dam to irrigate my land
  * leaves you with no water
  * hard to claim its my or your water
  * once i use the water its all gone, i can exploit you
ex) oil
  * could just stick a drill on your property, suck oil from surrounding area then nothing left

Solutions to common pool:

remedial: hard to sue without some kind of enforcable ownership (property) interest
criminal: definitial problems 
  * someone stole something that didnt belong to you?
Both are backwards instrument(s

There are Normas and Informal Arrangements that exist for some common pool problems
  * ex) overharvesting lobsters in mane had informall agreement (rita heimes)
