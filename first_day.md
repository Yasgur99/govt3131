# What is Law?
* We have norms (unwritten) and statues and constitutions (written) laws.
* First there was Common Law - judge made evolutionary law
* Then there was Positive Law (articulated legislation)
* We operate under a combination of both

## Law as a Problem Solver

* Remedial
	* You get harmed
	* Does money help resolve that?
* Penal/Criminal
	* There are certain things that are articulated in the law that are not acceptable
	* The state will take liberties away (jail)
	ex) You cannot steal, murder, etc
* Public Benefit
	* The govt/law does things for us to serve the people
	* How the legal actors can get this stuff done
	ex) create public park, covid vaccines, snow plowing
* Administrative
	* We want productivity, but don't want it to be unsafe/harmful.
	ex) Want to create a building, there are rules/codes
* Private Arrangment
	ex) Warranties, expectations
