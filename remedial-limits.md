# Limitations of Remedial Law

Damages that are hard to quantify
  * young face vs old face
  * child injured vs their potential in the future

# Hurley v. Eddingfield

Duty to rescue case

Facts:
* P was very ill
* D was the only doctor avaliable (in time to be of any use) - D knew this
* P had $$ to pay for services
* D was not seeing any other patioents and could have seen P in time
* D refuesed to treat
* As a result of not treating, the P was greviously harmed

Law on licence of doctors:
  * Qualifications, examinations, other licensing procedures
  * but NOT an affirmative duty to provide care
      * side note: but today the modern era says if its your doctor, there is a duty

Prior Procedings:
* P brought suit
* 10$ award on reasonable care/reasonable action
* D motion: Demurrer (no law upon which claim can be based)
  * Trial Court: granted

# Duty to Rescue?

Yania v Bigan:
  * landowner with a mining pit on his land with water in it
  * if you fell into it, you could drown
  * was standing on side of pit with associate
  * taunting associate "if you were a man you would jump into the pit. if you dont im going to doubt you are a real man"
  * the associate jumped in to prove his manliness
  * the associate was sucked into the pit, drowns and dies
  * did the man have a duty to jump in and save him?
  * dismissed count VIII (c) - no duty to rescue since he wasn't responsible for the man jumping in (taunting wasn't enough to make him responsible)
  
General rule: Absent special relationship, no duty to rescue

Why is this the general rule?
  * if there was a duty to rescue, it could bring harm to the rescuer
  * how to you quantify enough effort in the rescue
  * what if someone falls into the water but the rescuer cant swim?
  * what if the rescuer can swim but the current would make it impossible to save?
  * we presume people have control over their own selves (liberty) and duty of rescue encroaches on that
  * difficulty in defining (How alert? What skill level? Put people at risk?)

Special relationships:
  * ex) if the guy had pushed/tricked the guy into going into the hole
  * if you are responsible for the accident from happening
  * Baker v Taco Bell
    * falls down and hits his head
    * wakes up, goes to order, goes unconsious again and badly injures himself
    * employees do nothing
    * when he wakes up, his friends take him to the hospital
    * is there a duty on part of taco bell for a customer?
    * Yes, hes a **Business invitee**
  * Innkeeper, bus driver (common carrier), etc.
  * once you start you have to finish and use due care (but see good samaritan statutes)
    * if you start giving CPR and have no idea how to do CPR, you can be held liable
    * good samaritian statues allow trained emergency personell to be protected if something goes bad (if using due care)
  * Parents, spouses, school-students (minors), hospital-paitent (changes since Hurley), existing patient-doctor
