# Intro to Remedial (Tort)

Civil Suit

# Some Basics

Attempted solutions to which social problem?:
  * ex) neightbors buy fire pit but not careful using it. Eventually firepit explodes and burns down her and her neighbors house
    * she caused injury to her and others
  * ex) Liebeck v MCD - woman order coffee at first window, puts it between knees to get wallet out, squeezes cup and lid falls off and hot coffee severly burns her legs
      * she sues because shes injured and incurred medical bills and pain and psych injuries
  * ex) Brown v Kendall - two men with dogs and dogs start fighting. one man uses stick to break up fight but sticks other man in eye
      * injury, fracus, weilding stick. how to handle?
  * ex) piano falls out window, crushing someone on sidewalk

Goal: how do we get people to behave reasonably?
  * accidents happen because people aren't as careful as they should
  * while balancing that people are also productive
  * how to allocate costs when accidents occur? (shouldn't just fall on victim)
    * don't wan't people taking law into own hands
      * i.e. taking revenge
  * ex post - what can we do to make that person as if they had not been injured
  * ex ante - incentive to be more careful so they don't have to pay later on

Its a:
* social control
* by creating consequences
* and detering bad behavior
* aka aligns cost and benefits

ex) 
Mom: if you dont stop kicking wall im going to take your blue toy 
Daughter: kicks wall once mom leaves and the daughter put blue toy outside

Here, the law did not align the cost and benefits because she was willing to kick and give up toy

## Remedial Method

Note: *element* is the peice of evidence you must prove to recover in court
* Elements of tort (negligence)
  * duty
      * duty of care - what obligation do you have with respect to people around you?
      * do you have a greater duty to help others if you are a parent, landowner, etc.?
  * breach
    * breach of duty - did you fail to preform duty of care?
    * are you behaving reasonably?
    * Vaugn v Menlove - man had farm next door to other farm. 1st farmer put hay into hayricks along edge of property. hay ferments, causes heats, causes fire. fire burns cabins on other property
      * the neighbor notified the other farmer before hand that the hay could cause fire but farmer dismisses him
      * the neighbor wants to be compensated for this unreasonable behavior
      * what level of care does the first farmer owe to the other farmer? was this breached?
        * court says a reasonable farmer would have known to be more careful with hay
        * the farmer says he put things as reasonable as he could (ie im an unreasonable person) 
        * the court says its not your own personal ability, its the average sensible person under those circumstances might do
  * cause
    * you could be running around unreasonably but you don't cause any problems -- this is fine
    * cause in fact - what you did lead to what happened
    * proximate causation (aka substantial contribution) - what you did was close enough to actual injury that you should be held accountable
      * building matenence person told to clean apparment building with snack dispencer
      * he was using rag soaked in gasoline to clean snack dispencer
      * a rat lived under the machine, gas dripped on it, rat runs outside, person flicks cigarette onto street hits rat, car blows up and individual harm
      * was the maitenence worker at fault for the explsion in the street?
    * need both in fact and proximate causation
  * harm (injury)
    * say you caused a problem, but it didn't create harm, then whats the compensation? 
    * to body
    * to property
    * to emotion
    * to reputation
  
# The tough thing about harm

Figuring out the money to "make one whole"
easy if its a proeprty harm
  * car crash - can be valued on marketplace
harder if:
  * harm to face
    * does it matter if someone is more beautiful
    * does it matter if they had job with more forward facing clients?
  * hand injured
    * does it matter if its infant vs older person? loss of future value?
      * what is the infants value in the future? will they use their hands alot?

# Damages as Remedial Method

Origin
  * Common law - mid 1800s
    * becomes more specific and commonality
    * start of industrial revolution
      * companies/workplaces causing harm to people
      * previously harm was to family or neighbors
      * also more harm incidents 
    * initially judge made (eventually becomes statutory)
      * judge says how much and under what circumstances
      * judge watches how this worked and adapts based on new cases
      * these decisions end up becoming statuory
    * importance of stare decisis and facts
      * developing the law by analogy to previous cases

  * Need to value hard to value things
    * society has said too hard to leave to jury and judges
    * ex) "if exposure of bone ... III Shillings"
    * ex) "for each of the 4 front teeth ... VI shillings"
    * letislature says what happens

# Legislative? NY Worker's Comp Loss of Use

Things that are hard to value are written in law
Tradeoff: 
  * worker doesn't have to pay for litigation (which would be expensive/difficult)
  * company can buy into insurace to help pay for this (avoid uncertany so they can budget better)
See Maximum Possible Compensation chart (Tort Substitute)
  * member loss v weeks of compensation


# Some Basics

* Civil Law
  * Plaintiff usually a private party (person/corp)
  * Liable or Not Liable (no "guilty" here)
    * owes or does not owe $$
  * Burden of proof
    * with how much certainty do you need to prove certain claim?
    * on the person asserting the damage
    * Burden: *Preponderance of the evidence*
      * more likley than not (51%)
      * why not higher/lower?
        * high = beyond reasonable doubt
        * low = some credible evidence
        * the reason: it would be hard to prove duty beyond reasonable doubt
        * the reason: if only some credible evidence, then too many people would be compensating which could have backwards incentives


# Law Suit Examples

ex) 
* dolphins encouraged to spray front two rows with water at aquarium
* dolphin splashes woman, ruins her clothing
* woman sues for training dolphins to recklessly spraying water
* suit goes nowhere

ex) 
* administrative judge has favorite pair of pants
* took pants to cleaner. cleaner ruins pants
* sues dry cleaners for mental suffering, inconvenience, and discomfort for $54 million
* suit goes nowhere

ex) 
* BP Oil spill in gulf
* damages to environment and businesses in area
* settled for $7.8 million

ex)
* takata airbags sells bags to different car companies
* bags would deploy along with shrapenal which harmed people

# Plus and Minus

Plus
* keeps dangerous items out of our hands
  * before and after the fact
ex) Playgrounds
  * public entities harder to sue but,...
  * there used to be a metal barrel revolving on pipe to balance on
  * this is dangerous and have largley disapeared because of the liability it created
ex) Tylenol (1982)
  * someone put cyanide in tylenol bottle in drugstores (not sealed)
  * 7 people died 
  * today, over the counter drugs are sealed and proofed.
  * today, food often does this too
ex) informed consent
  * Doctor needs your consent before performing procedures

Minus
* Cost to our economy
  * lawsuits
  * damage payments
  * the cost to business for tort is 300-350 billion per year
* High Risk Specialists Deterred? (OBGYN)
ex)
* Piper Cub Airplanes had many crashes
* company could not withstand lawuits even though the airplanes might not have been the fault
* now the world does not get to use their product
