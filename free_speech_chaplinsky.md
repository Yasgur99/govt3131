# An Introductory Case

How the lagal system works using:
	* facts
	* prior procedings
	* issues
	* decisions
	* reasons

## Village of Skokie v Natl. Socialist Party of America

### Prior Procedings

* Preliminary Injunction - emergency action. party comes to court and says we can't wait for normal pace because damage will occur if action not taken immediatley
	* Skokie asks for this injunction
	* This is an extreme measure
	* The court does a balancing test
		* Will skokie suffer some ireprebale harm
		* Skokie says populous would be irreprebly harmed
		* This is balanced against the harm in stopping Collins from marching at this time
	* The village must show it is extremley likley they will win in court later on
		* Higher burden
	* This was brought in IL **state** court
		* State courts have general jurisdiction
		* Federal courts have limited jurisdiction - fed question an diversity
			* diversity - argument between entities/citizens in different states
			* fed question - treaty, statute, constitution
		* Federal courts are more difficult to access
	* This class is a federal case because its about the First Amendment 
	* This is a civil case
		* Criminial case - government (state or federal) passed a law (enacted statute) that specifically makes behavior punishible by taking away liberties
		* Civil case - entities disputing with each other about some type of behavior
	
	* Trial Court Holding
		* preliminary injuction granted
		* says party cannot display Nazi armband nor distribute pamphlets
	* Collins appeals
		* Trial court granted preliminary injunction in error because it's a 1st Amendment violation
		* Holding by apellate court
			* Protest is ok but cannot wear swastikas
	* Collins appeals again to IL Supreme Court

### IL Supreme Court

**Discretionary Review** - Court has the ability to say what cases it will and will not take

IL Supreme Court agrees to hear the case

Issue:
	* Does the ban on the swastikas violate the 1st Ammendmenet?
Decision:
i	* Reversed in part:
		* Denying right to wear swastika violates 1st A.
		* The rest of the decision from the appelate court was fine
		**Per curium** - No one justice identified themself as the author of the court. The decision was issued on behalf of the court as a whole
Reasons:
	* Include prior case law to show its being consistent or give explanation to revisions to past reasoning
	* Authoratative reasons
		* Statutes and Constition
		* Prior Case law
			* Tinker
			* Chaplinksy
			* Cohen
	* Institutional Reasons
	* Goal Reasons
	* Rightness Reasons
		
### 1st Amendtment Framework

"Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech"

Is there government action?
	* Yes, State actors cannot 1st A. (if there wasn't, it would be okay to limit)
Is it affecting speech?
	* Yes, speech includes expression, writing, texting, art, music, symbolism, etc. (if there wasn't, it would be okay to limit)
Is it content/speaker based (targeting someone because of who they are or because of what they are saying)?
	* Yes, and prior restraint shifts burden to govt to respond to what occurs because of the speech. 
	* A permit or injuction shows prior restraint
	* If it wasn't content/speaker based, is it a reasonable time, manner, or place?
		* If reasonable, okay to limit
		* else, 1st violation
Is speech in lesser protected class?
	* Certain categories of speech can be restricted
		* Includes fighting/imminent danger (fighting words or incitement to riot)
		* True threats/harrassment
		* Child pornography
		* Obscenity (never really used because definition of obscene is ever changing)
		* False, misleading, illegal commercial speech
		* Defamation (libel/slander) (must be lies)
		* OK to limit these
		* else, 1st Violation
Also, the government must have a narrowly tailored limitation to serve compelling government interest.

## Stare Decis

AKA **precedent**
	* The cases decided before this one
	* Are our case facts more liek A or B case facts?
	* What are the differences between this case and those cases?
	* Reasoning by comparison. 

## Questions about Skokie and 1st

Do we have "speech"?
	* Tinker v. Des Moines - students wore armbands to school with peice signs to protest war. Armbands were expression.
	* The swastika is speech
	* Some cases that also deal with speech - burning draft card (obrien), Nude dancing (Barnes v Glen Theatre)
	* Today, we use protected balancing analysis 
Is this prior restraint?
	* Yes, permit and injunction
	* So higher burden to justify
	* Presumed unconstitutional
Is this content based?
	* Yes, its because its a Swastika. Skokie is targeting a specific expression
Does this speech fall into an unprotected category (lesser protection)
	* Perhaps falls into the fighting words category
		* Worried about possible violent counter protest
	* What case does the court look to?
		* Chaplinsky
	* Offensive words that cause harm to the hearer that compell someone into violent action

# Chaplinsky

**New Hampshire Law**: "No person shall address any offensive, derisive or annoying word to any other person who is lawfully in any street or other public place, nor call him by an offensive or derisive name, nor make any noise or exclamation in his presence and hearing with intent to deride, offend or annoy him, or prevent him from pursuing his lawful business or occupation."

This is very broad language.

Facts:

Jehovas witness stopping people on street and prostletizing them about his beliefs.
Handing out literature
Calling other religions a "racket"
Public complaints
Police warnings: crowds being restless
Worried crowd might react
Escored (removed) from street by police

As being removed he said "You are a God damned racketeer" and "a damned Fascist and the whole government of Rochester are Fascists or agents of Fascists."
At this time, this language was a lot less expected.

Issue: Does NH law on its face or as applied in this situation violate the 1st A?

Decision: Upheld
"Lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or "fighting" words"

Reasons:
Court says resort to epithets or personal abuse is not in any proper sense communication of information or opinion safeguarded by the Constitution.

Is that problematic? Is this really not communication? Are specific words not acceptible?
Since then, this and similar statues have been struct down as too broad.

## Application of Chaplinsky

Does National Socialist Party speech fall into an exception (or unprotected category)?
	* Court says? No
How is *Chaplinsky* different?
	* In Chaplinsky, the speech was directly in the officers face. 
	* In Skokie, not directed at any specific individual.
	* Chaplinsky punishment after the fact (already creating a problem)
	* Skokie refusal (punishment) before the fact
	* The officer in Chaplinsky needed to hold back from fighting
	* In Skokie, people who would get offended don't need to go
