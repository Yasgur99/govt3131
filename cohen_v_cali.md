# Cohen v. Califonia

* Convicted for "maliciously and wilfully disturb[ing] the peace or quiet of any neighborhood or person ... by ... ofensive conduct"
	* For wearing a jacket bearing the words "Fuck the Draft" in the LA Courthouse
* Court of Appeal held that "offensive conduct" means "behavior which has tendency to provoke others to acts of violence to in turn disturb the peace"
* Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction
* Supreme Court held there was not a particularized and compelling reason for the state to prohibit this type of expression.

## Majority Opinion

* Defendant did not engage, threaten, nor cause any violence
* The conviction rests upon the asserted offensiveness of the words
* The only conduct the State wants to punish is speech
* As long as there is no showing of an intent to incite disobedience to or disruption of the draft, he cannot be punished for what his jacket said
* Offensive conduct does not inform which "certain places" (ie court house) are appropriate or not
* He was not being obscene
* This is not fighting words because
	* "Not directed to the person of the hearer" (not a personal insult)
	* Did not intentionally provoke a given group to a hostile reaction
* "We are often captives outside the sanctuary of the home and subject to objectionable speech."
	 * But it is not the role of the government to stop discourse to protect others from hearing from it (must be a more compelling reason)
	* This breif exposure is not enough to limit (a person could easily avert their eyes)

* Verbal, tumult, discord, and offesnive utterance are necessary sidef effects of the broader enduring values which the process of open debate permits us to achienve
* The statute of "offensive words" is boundless (how can you distinguish offensive words"
* These words envoke emotion. Thats the point. That gets the message communicated. That should ont be limited

# Dissent

* Cohens actions was maily conduct and little speech

# Discussion Section

Was there an exception to the first amendment?
1. Was it obscenity?
Was not sexual interest
2. Was it fighting words?
Not addressed to someone specifically

The first amendment protects unwanted speech (?) The court says this is an expense of free speech
