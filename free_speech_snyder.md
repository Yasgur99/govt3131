# Free Speech - Snyder

Todays Goal: How does chalpinsky and cohen apply to other cases?

# A Quick Recap of Harlan's Opinion in Cohen

"The constituional right of free expression is powerful medicine in a society as diverse and populous as ours"
	* recognition that we have a diverse society
	* because of that free speech allows us to interact in a way we can learn and better our society

"... in the hope that use of such freedom will ultimatley produce a more capable citizenry and more perfect polity"
	* create a better society
	* to get there, people need to pursuade one another
	* in order to pursuade, view points must be able to be exchanged

"and in the beliefe that no other approach would comport with the premise of individual dignity and choice upon which our politcal system rests"
	* scott principle - ability to express oneself
	* there isn't anything better that gets us to this place

"so long as the means are peaceful, the communication not meet standards of acceptability"
	* brandon burg v ohio
	* violent action is one thing, talking about change is another
	
# Law from Past cases

**(Cohen) California Law**:

* penal code punishes anyone who willfully disturbs peace or quiet by loud noise or offensive conduct, threats, quarreling, challege to fight, or fighting, vulgar profane or indence language
* how do we know what is indencent language?

**(Chaplinksy) New Hampshire Law:**
* no person shall address any offensive, derisive, or annoying word to any other person who is in any streat or public place

# "easy" current cases

Easy because unanimous decision
Lanham Act (trademark): no trademark shall be granted if it is immoral, deceptive, or scandalous; or matter which may disparage...
Trademarks are worthwile because it protects an entity from being misrepresented by others
Pattent and Trademark office approves/denies trademarks
They use the Lanham Act to set the rules of the road for approval/denial
Is the Lanham Act excerpt too broad?
Should the board decide who we say we are and how we brand ourselves?

Iancu v Burnetti (2017) challanges immoral, deceptive, or scandalous
	* Provacator artist
	* launched clothing brand
	* wanted clothing brand "FUCT" (Friends U Can't Trust)
	* trademark office says FUCT is immoral or scandalous and therefore not worthy of trademark

Matal v Tam (2017) challanges the disparage part
* Simon Tam's band
* They were an asian american group
* name of band was "The Slants"
* Slants is a slur against asian ameriancs
* wanted to make social commentary about the name
* wanted to sell T-Shirts with name of band so they want to protect the financial parts so they want trademark
* trademark office says it may disparage group of asian ameriancs
* tam says but we are asian americans. why cant they have this political message?
* court says Lanham Act is 1st amendment violation

Burnetti ruled in favor of Matal so it was clear what the decision was going to be in the Burnetti case

# Balancing Public Healt, Saftey and Welfare

* Expression causing unlawful conduct (immediate) ... Fighting Words (Incitement) (?)
	* can be limited
	* incitement to riot can be punished
	* must be immediate and specific 
		* in front of crowd with bats
		* have intent of who or where
	* internet poses a problem for this because its not necessarily immediate
	* so the question of immediate is less aplicable when using communication that doesn't appear (internet)
	* law hasn't moved in that direction yet but some scholars are considering if we need to rething immediate threat
	* Lesser protected, not unprotected
* Publishing Confidential Information
	* govt, companies, entities have real reason to have confidentiality
	* this need outweighs full on free speech
	* sometimes the press releasing confidential that was passed on
	* the person who aquired the confidential and passed it on is the one liable
* true threats
	* less 1st amendment protection
	* Elonis v US 2015 - Elonis published on facebook a series of threatning poems against his x-wife, FBI, Kindergarden class
		* prossecuted for harrasment and threatning
		* court says you need objective intent (reasonable person would think that)
		* Elonis challanges the court - he says he needs to indend to commit the crime, not what other people think the intention is
		* Also challanges on 1st A basis. Court agrees that lyrics were not threats, just rap lyrics (even though they were specific!)
			* eminem wrote album about his ex-wife and made lots of money and it was no problem since it as "just rap"
		* Court send back down to figure out what his intention was
* public harms?
	* to children and privacy get more play
	* false commercial vulgarity (FCC)
	* budweiser had women in bikini
		* guy sues because he drank budweiser and no bikini women showed up
			* court says get outta here
	* if its a viable claim the court will recognize it
	* vulgarity (FCC)
		* policing whats on public air waves (raidio, tv)
			* FCC sets standars of whats allowed
			* this has erroded over time
	
FCC v Pacifica (1978)
* Carlan is a comedian
* Had routine of 7 dirty words you cant say on TV or radio
* Everyone knew what his routine was (and what the words were)
* Believed in pushing the line
* His commentary was how harmful were these words?
* He said it on radio and FCC punishes him and radio station
* Court hears it on first A challange

* Conern of Children/Home
	* idea of invading the privacy of the home with horrifying words

Time of day, audience, context matter (justice sutherland)
 * justice argues its okay if its late at night but not okay
 * Todays defintion of pig in parlor is changing
 * time of day is problematic, especially because the internet because things can be accessed at any time

# Village of Skokie

Decision: reversed in part: deny right to wear swastika violates 1st amendment

Reasons:
* govt action and speech (symbolic - tinker)
* Prior restraint and content based - swastika on shirt
* balancing in favor of speech: no exception or highly compelling reason to restrict
	* not fighting words (Chaplinsky)
	* as a social solution, its better to tell people to avert eyes rather than limit speech
		* absent adressee (quasi-absent)
		* listener not truly invaded or captured
	* insufficent conern about harm/violence from offence (Cohen)
	* KKK and nazis hold this stuff all the time, but appropriate police is there to stop things from happening


# Cases and Issues to Watch

**Public Health Regulations and 1st A**
Black Raven Tatoo Parlor
Are tatoos expression
Court has said yes
Its like an armband, and with you for rest of your life
Tatoo Artist means its an art

Mitchell v. Newson (Dec 2020)
US District Court CA
* Business limited due to covid
* Argument tatoo companies/artist making is that to close business denys them to express art
* Temp Restraining Order denied due to time, manner, placed
	* must show irreprebal harm by halting ability to speak/make art
	* govt not experiencing great detriment
	* court holds in favor of govt saying this is reasonable time manner place restriction
	* not restricting based on content
	* expressions could be shared on web or elsewhere
* Restrictions also being made on non-art places (hair salons, nails, clothing)
	* hairs and nails and clothing might be art

* Elane Photography and masterpiece Cake
	* baker cant turn away for same sex marriage
	* this is a baker note wanting to express himself
	* this is called forced speech
	* this is also protected
	* TRO denied (time manner place)
	* Justice Kagan wants to know is cake artistic expression?
	* elane didnt want to take photos of same sex wedding
	
* Mask wearing refusal and expression
* Parker v Wolf (PA, Dec 2020)
* challanged mask wearing mandate
* mask wearing is political symbol to show you believed in science behind covid and you agreed with massive shutdowns and govt intervention is necessary
* district court injunction denied (standing and particularized harm)
	* court says plantiffs dont have standing because there must be actual case where there is real harm and there has to be specific harm to you
	* mask wearing enforcement is non-existant (even though its a mandate)
	* because you were never told you must put it on, there is no particularized injury

Enforcement:
Protests & Political Gatherings v Business
Time place manner neutral (nobody can go out in large groups)
But if the enforcement is different for different groups, then there are problems
Businesses are bringing cases that argue that they can't bring people in to congregate
Protests and Political Gatherings are occuring and are not being prevented, so is this a problem of govt enforcing from some but not others?
	* Free speech problem because content based
	* but what expression are businesses making?
		* commercial speech
		* art?

Nevada restrictions on entities public, religious, private on how many people you can have
Businesses: 50% capacity
Religious organizations: no more than 50 people or 50% capacity (whichever is smaller)
Religious gatherings vs secular activities
Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley v Sisolak (9th circuit)
Speaker based, content based differntiation (not neutral time place manner)
Thats a 1st problem
